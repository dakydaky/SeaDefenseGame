# SeaDefenseGame


This is a carbon copy of a project as it was on GitLab of elte.hu (University). Due to the fact that the access to University-bound GitLab repositories seems to be moderated by administrators of the said University, I have made a new repository here with the source code, as well as a built Standalone application that is ready to run. 

This is therefore a showcase repository for my own employment possibilities (2020).
